1. Write a good descriptive summary of your changes

The changes we made were making a empty array of names.  A function the abbrevated the names.  A variable that turns the names into an array then split them into 2 different names that took the first letter of the names and turned it back into a string and concatanted the two with a . between them.

2. Be sure to include how much time you spent on it and who you worked with.

We worked on this lab for about 3hrs.  Nick drove and I navigated.  We switch for white boarding. and took turns looking up docs and trying out different approaches.

3. Briefly reflect on and summarize your process.

The process went pretty well.  Our first few attempts we were making thing a lot harder then they had to be.  White boarding helped to be able to see what parts needed to plug into others.
