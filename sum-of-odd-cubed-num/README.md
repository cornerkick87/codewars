1. Find the sum of the odd numbers within an array, after cubing the initial integers. This function will return undefined (NULL in PHP) if any of the values aren't numbers.


2. Be sure to include how much time you spent on it and who you worked with.
We worked about an 1hr on this kata.

3. The process went amazing and was alot easier then I thought before whiteboard.
