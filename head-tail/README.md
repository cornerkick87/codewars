1. Write a good descriptive summary of your changes

The changes we made were we had an array of meerkat parts.  The parts needed to be reversed. So we made a function that would call on the array and in return it reversed.

2. Be sure to include how much time you spent on it and who you worked with.

We worked on this lab for about 20min.  Sarah drove and I navigated.  Sarah white boarding.  Then we looked up our solution in google.  https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp 

3. Briefly reflect on and summarize your process.

The process went amazing and was alot easier then I thought before whiteboard.
